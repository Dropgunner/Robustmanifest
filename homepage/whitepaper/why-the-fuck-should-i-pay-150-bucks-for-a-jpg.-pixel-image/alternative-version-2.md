As of this moment (12/07/2023), the going rate for a single unit of Ethereum stands at approximately 1600 dollars. Were we to launch our project today, the acquisition of one NFT would set you back about 160 dollars. To put this into perspective, the average price tag on a triple-A video game is 80 US dollars. Thus, for the cost of two such games, you're not merely supporting developers who voluntarily dedicate their time and expertise to coding, driven by their passion for Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) development. You're also contributing to a sustainable development model.

This model echoes the principles articulated in the GNU Manifesto, a seminal document advocating for software freedom. The manifesto posits that software should be free in the sense of granting users the liberty to use, study, modify, and distribute it. It contends that software restrictions are detrimental to society and that sharing software is a fundamental act of camaraderie among programmers.

Hypothetically, if all 10,000 NFTs find buyers, this would amass a capital pool of roughly 1.6 million dollars. With conservative staking, this would translate into an annual revenue stream of 80,000 dollars, or about 6,500 dollars per month. These funds could be sustainably channeled into the development of the SS13 open source remake. This sum equates to the salary of two full-time developers or several times the current bounties of existing SS13 remake projects, all while preserving the decommodification of SS13 as a community-driven open source project.

Purchasers of the NFTs also gain an exchangeable asset, its value reflected in the NFT's rarity. Given market dynamics, one could reasonably expect to resell their NFT for an equal or higher price, contingent on a successful launch and the rarity score of the specific NFT. By incorporating a dividend of the sale into the smart contract via platforms like OpenSea, the sales would further bolster the funding for developers, adding to the capital pool. It's reasonable to assume that this innovative approach resonates with the gaming community and aligns with the fundamental principles of open source development, as encapsulated in the GNU Manifesto.
