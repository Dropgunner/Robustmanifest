# Why the fuck should I pay 150 bucks for a jpg. pixel image?!!!!!!!!

As today (which is the 12/07/2023) the current price of 1 Ethereum is about 1600 dollars. If we would deploy our project today to buy one nft would cost about 160 bucks. The current list price for a tripple a video game is 80 Us dollars. That means for the price of 2 video games you not only support developers who are investing their time and effort in coding for free because they want to in the spirit of FOSS development. In theory if all 10000 gets sold this would generate a capital pool of about 1.6 million dollars with conservatively staking would mean a revenue stream of 80000 $ per year so about 6500 buck per month which can be invested sustainably in the development of the particular ss13 open source remake.  That is the salary of 2 full time hired devs or multiple times the current bounties of the current ss13 remake projects without losing the aspect of decommodificatios of ss13 as an open source project from the community. \

the buyer also holds an exchange of value displayed in the nft and its rarity. Following market mechanisms one can expect, with the condition of a successful launch, to at least resell ones own nft for the same price or higher depening of the rarity score of the particular nft. Implementing in the smart contract a dividend of the sale via opensea ect... the sales will additionally generate funding for the developers getting into the capital pool. It can be to assume that this basic idea hits a nerve in the gaming community and resonates with the basic principles of open source development What has been presented in the [Gnu Manifest](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.html)
