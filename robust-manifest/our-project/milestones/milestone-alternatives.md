# Milestone alternatives

Development of the NFTs: This milestone involves flexing your robust skills to create the most badass NFTs the galaxy has ever seen. You'll need to channel your inner space cowboy to design the tokens, tokenize them like a pro, and develop smart contracts that are tougher than a veteran security officer.

Launch of the NFT sale: Once the NFTs are created, it's time to show them off to the world and prove that they're worth their weight in gold. You'll need to market them like a mastermind, set a sale date that's hotter than the core of a star, and create a plan for the sale that's more intricate than a top-secret conspiracy.

Distribution of funds: Now that the NFT sale is over and you've amassed a fortune, it's time to divvy up the loot like a true space pirate. You'll need to pay off developers like they're your crewmates, fund marketing efforts that are more epic than a round-ending event, and cover any other expenses related to the project like a seasoned captain.

Development of the open-source Space Station 13 remakes: With the funds secured, it's time to get down to business and develop the remakes like a robust genius. You'll need to hire developers that are more skilled than a legendary wizard, set development timelines that are tighter than a malfunctioning airlock, and oversee the process with an iron fist.

Beta testing of the remakes: Once the remakes are developed, it's time to unleash them on a select group of players and see if they can handle the robustness. You'll need to invite testers that are more skilled than a veteran spessman, gather feedback that's more valuable than a rare artifact, and make any necessary changes that are more precise than a pinpoint laser.

Launch of the remakes: With the beta testing complete and the final touches applied, it's time to launch the remakes like a fireworks display. You'll need to market the game like a god-tier influencer, set a launch date that's more hyped than a station-wide emergency, and ensure that the game is ready to blow players away like a fully-charged singularity. %
