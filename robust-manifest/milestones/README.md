# Milestones

. Development of the NFTs: This milestone involves creating the most robust NFTs the universe has ever seen. Our team of experienced spacemen will design, tokenize, and develop smart contracts for the NFTs. The NFTs will be the backbone of the project, ensuring that our efforts to fund open-source Space Station 13 remakes are as robust as they can be.

Launch of the NFT sale: Once we've crafted the most robust NFTs in the galaxy, we'll launch the sale and watch as they fly off the virtual shelves. We'll market the NFTs to potential buyers, set a sale date, and create a plan to make the sale as robust as possible. The launch will be a galactic event, with people from all corners of the universe lining up to get their hands on our robust NFTs.
