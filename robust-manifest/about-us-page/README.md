  *   About Us {Project Name} is an art collection made by prolific contributors to various SS13 servers and its remakes. Spriters who have contributed to Eris, Tau Ceti, /tg/station, (verify with spriters and list the most prolific names) have reimagined many classic SS13 clothes, items, and locations in a 64x64 style. They were eager to stretch their creative muscles in a new style, but could this be a vision of a 64x64 future?
