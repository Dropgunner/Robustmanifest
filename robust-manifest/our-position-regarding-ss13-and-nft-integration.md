# Our Position Regarding SS13 and NFT Integration

We want to make a clear and definitive statement about our intentions for Space Station 13 (SS13) remakes and their relationship to our NFT project, "Robust Manifest". It is important to underscore that we do not plan to monetize SS13 remakes or attempt to integrate NFTs into these games. We respect the long-standing principles and ethos of the SS13 community and acknowledge that the implementation of such an approach would likely be met with resistance.

Our NFT project employs a decentralized financial model: all generated funds go into a decentralized vault based on Ethereum (ETH). These funds are managed through a combination of Proof of Stake (PoS) and other decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. The interest and returns generated from this approach will be used to finance open-source game development, particularly for SS13 remake projects.

While our project provides a novel approach to financing open-source game development, we do not presume to dictate how other projects or entities should conduct their operations. In other words, we do not prohibit or discourage other open-source remake projects or companies from exploring the potential of NFTs as a fundraising or monetization tool.

Furthermore, it's crucial to mention that our financial aid will be distributed evenly among SS13 remake projects. We do not favor one project over the other, promoting a fair and impartial allocation of resources.

We do not purport to be an official SS13 remake project. We understand and respect that SS13 is a revered brand in the PC gaming community, often referred to as a "copyleft" brand due to its open-source nature. We are well aware of the legacy and significance of SS13, and we do not aim to co-opt or overshadow that.

Our core value with "Robust Manifest" is to pioneer a new and innovative approach to funding open-source game development. This venture takes inspiration from SS13 but our intention is not to capitalize on the name or legacy of SS13. Rather, we seek to champion a cause that we believe is important - promoting the sustainable development of open-source games, with this project specifically geared towards fostering successful remakes of SS13.
