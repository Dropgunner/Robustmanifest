# The Story of Robust Manifest

our NFT project, "Robust Manifest", has a backstory as unique and quirky as the Space Station 13 community itself.

Once upon a time, in a spacetime continuum parallel to ours, there was an expansive galactic federation, the "Robust Coalition." They held a simple mandate: to ensure the development of open-source games throughout the galaxy.

However, it was not as easy as it sounded. A malicious alien syndicate, the "Closed Sourcers," thrived on restrictive licensing, stunting the growth of open-source game development.

The Coalition devised a plan to create a series of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) - unique artifacts of immense power, known as the "Robust Manifest." Each NFT was imbued with the robust spirit of the Coalition, holding the power to sustain open-source game development.

The Closed Sourcers caught wind of this and attempted to sabotage the plan, but the Coalition managed to launch a selection of NFTs into the vast reaches of space. Their trajectory? The spacetime continuum where SS13 existed.

And so, the Robust Manifest NFTs landed in our universe, discovered by us. We now have a critical mission: to harness their power, fund open-source game development, and perhaps, create successful SS13 remakes.

While we respect the sanctity of SS13 and its community, we hope this initiative helps create a robust future for open-source games. As bearers of the "Robust Manifest," we're just doing our part in the grand cosmic scheme to uphold the spirit of open-source gaming!
